### About Barbarian

The Barbarian Data System is an in-memory, parallel, distributed (MPP) data warehousing engine designed to be deployed to Kubernetes clusters, offering Apache Hive for powerful and flexible SQL based analytics. Barbarian includes an integrated in-memory filesystem and can run in three modes of operation.
* As an in-memory, standalone data warehousing system
* As a data warehousing system backed by an external storage system like Amazon S3
* In a hybrid mode, where primary storage is the external storage system, with common paths mounted to the in-memory filesystem

Barbarian includes compelling features including Apache Hive LLAP and Tez, with transactional tables enabled by default. 

Barbarian's integrated Ignite in-memory distributed parallel filesystem is resilient to node failure with replication enabled by default.

Barbarian has no single points of failure.
